# Historical Cryptocurrency Price Finder

This is a Chrome Extension to find the past price of a cryptocurrency, using CoinMarketCap's graph data.  Currently working but not production ready.


## Download and Use
Download the repository as a folder, then go to your Extensions and make sure Developer Mode is enabled. Click the "Load unpacked extension" button and select the folder.  The extension should now be active.

To use, highlight any text while holding the ctrl button down.  If it follows a date or date and time format that the extension is looking for, it will make that text hoverable and display a tooltip where you can select the cryptocurrency you want to check, and even change the date and time if needed.  When you select the crypto, it will look up the price, and if it finds it, the price will be displayed on the price row.
